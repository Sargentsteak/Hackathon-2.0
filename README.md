# Unofficial-hackathon
Its a basic dynamic website for a company.It has 3 components  : Manager, Lead, Resource.
Manager has the access only to the core functionalities of the Resource and the task.

The Manager can 
* add or delete projects 
* assign the projects to the Lead.

The Lead can 
* Accept projects form th manager and assign particular tasks to the Resource which is basically the employee of thr company.

The Resource can
* Accept and complete tasks.
* Delete tasks once they are completed.
* Request to be assigned a new tak if they are not being able to comprehend or complete the given task at hand.
The Manager can oversee the Leads work. 
We have designed a different homepage for each of the above components.
The Login/sign up will act as a barrier between the 3 functionalities namely the Manager , the Lead and the Resource.
